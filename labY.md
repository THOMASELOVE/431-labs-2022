431 Lab Y
================
Deadline: See Course Calendar \| Last Edited 2022-12-04 8:49 PM

Write a clear and well-composed essay of 200 to 300 words describing an important idea from David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics* about doing statistical science well that Dr. Love didn't cover in Classes 1-24. Your essay should state the idea in your own words, and should indicate why you feel it is important.

If you quote Spiegelhalter (and we prefer that you do), specify the Chapter containing your quote. If Dr. Love discussed your idea in class, you'll lose 1 of 4 available points. If your essay is unclear, or if you miss Spiegelhalter's point, that will have a bigger impact on your score. Each Chapter in Spiegelhalter includes a summary of key points. Feel free to use these summaries to help spark ideas, but do not quote the summaries.

Use any software to produce your Word document, Google Doc, or PDF submission, and submit your work on Canvas in the Lab Y assignment.

This Lab is optional, and is designed to give you all a chance to weigh in on something you've learned without too much time pressure.
