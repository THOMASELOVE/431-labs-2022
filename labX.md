Lab X is a bonus lab, which consists of building a professional website.

# Background

One of our former TAs, Wyatt Bensken, built his own
[website](https://wyattbensken.com) using R, RStudio, and RMarkdown. We
decided it would be a worthwhile opportunity for others, who wish to
gain some bonus points, to build their own professional website. Not
only will this give you some additional practice coding and using R and
R-adjacent tools, it’s a low-cost and potentially high-yield method to
establish your professional presence online.

Wyatt wrote more about his motivation and experience building the
website in [this blog
post](https://wyattbensken.com/post/building-website/). His blog post
also walks through how he built his site.

# Instructions and Guidance

We want you to build a professional looking website that will be useful
to you. The content is up to you, and what you’d like to share but it’s
worth considering using this opportunity to craft your online presence.
This is also an opportunity to learn how to use Quarto for the purpose.
Quarto is sort of a souped-up version of R Markdown, and Dr. Love uses
it to generate most of his materials for the course.

-   The Quarto website shows you how to create a blog website within R
    Studio [in some detail
    here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).
-   Quarto’s general guide to [Creating a
    Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) may also be helpful.
-   Beatriz Milz’ [Creating a blog with Quarto in 10
    Steps](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/)
-   Albert Rapp’s [The Ultimate Guide to Starting a Quarto
    Blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html)
-   CrumpLab gives us [Blogging with Quarto: A 10 minute getting started
    tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoKjBcuUP0s) (about 10
    minutes)
-   Isabella Velásquez at RStudio has a YouTube video called [Building a
    Blog with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVcvXfRyfE0) (just
    over an hour)
-   Thomas Mock shows you how to [Create & Publish a Quarto Blog on
    Quarto Pub in 100
    Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8qtcDyCRFA)

Some of you may prefer to create a website with R Markdown, in which
case [the blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) can be of
substantial help.

Follow whichever approach is best for you and you feel most comfortable
with, or use the web to find some other options for how to best do this
sort of thing using R and Quarto (I hope) or something else like
[Owlstown](https://www.owlstown.com/), Wix, Google Sites or WordPress
(if necessary).

The key thing is to commit to making this a part of your life going
forward, however you most effectively do that.
